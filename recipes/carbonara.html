    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Carbonara is an Italian pasta dish traditionally made with eggs, cheese (usually Pecorino Romano or Parmesan), pancetta or guanciale (Italian cured pork), and black pepper. The hot pasta is tossed with the egg mixture, which creates a creamy sauce without the use of cream, and the rendered fat from the meat adds richness and flavor. It’s simple but incredibly flavorful, with a perfect balance of salty, creamy, and smoky elements.
    </p>
    <p>To make carbonara, cook pasta and toss it with a mixture of beaten eggs, grated cheese, and freshly ground black pepper. Add crispy pancetta or guanciale, mixing quickly to create a creamy sauce from the egg mixture without scrambling the eggs.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>Carbonara ingredients include pasta, eggs, grated Pecorino Romano or Parmesan cheese, pancetta or guanciale, black pepper, and sometimes olive oil or garlic for added flavor.

    <ol>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a large heavy saucepan over medium heat. Sauté shallots until softened. Stir in bacon and onion; cook and stir until bacon is evenly browned. Stir in garlic when bacon is about half done. Remove from heat.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente. Drain pasta, then return it to the pot.</li>
