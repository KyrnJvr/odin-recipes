    <h2>Description</h2>
    <h3>Baked mac, short for baked macaroni and cheese, is a comfort food dish made by combining cooked macaroni pasta with a creamy cheese sauce—typically made from cheddar or a blend of cheeses—and then baking it in the oven until the top is golden and slightly crispy. It’s often enriched with milk, butter, and flour to create a smooth béchamel base and may be topped with breadcrumbs or extra cheese for added texture.</h3>
    <p>To make baked mac, cook macaroni pasta and mix it with a creamy cheese sauce made from butter, milk, flour, and shredded cheese.</p>
    <p>Transfer to a baking dish, top with more cheese or breadcrumbs, and bake until the top is golden and bubbly.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>This creamy baked mac and cheese recipe is one I first made three years ago when I was in California. When I got back to Texas, I made it for my mom. This is now her favorite macaroni and cheese. She begs me to make it when I come to visit.</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Melt butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Sauté onion for 2 minutes. Stir in flour and cook for 1 minute, stirring constantly.

        </li>
        <li>Then stir in milk, salt, mustard, and pepper. Cook, stirring frequently, until mixture boils and thickens.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, bring a pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add macaroni and cook until al dente, 8 to 10 minutes; drain.</li>
        <li>Add Cheddar and American cheeses to milk mixture; stir until cheese melts.</li>
        <li>Combine cheese sauce and macaroni in a 2-quart baking dish; mix well.</li>
